                <p>Hey There!</p>
                <p>
                My name is Zac, and I am a designer/diy-er/maker/tries-to-be-fun person who lives on the North side of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I have a dog named 'Yoni,' an amazing girlfriend, and too many project vehicles and motorcycles to fit in my single-car garage.
                </p>  
                <p>After dropping out of a small liberal arts college in 2008 (majoring in Russian Studies and Mathematics), I moved to Minneapolis in pursuit of the big city life and to be just a number at the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities. </p>
                <p>I dropped out yet again to pursue a job handling baggage, working the ticket counter, and more importantly, smuggling French Bulldog puppies under the radar of my employer both nationally and internationally for some mad cash profit.     
                <p> At some point, I decided I didn't like sleeping in airports, and I didn't get into an electrican apprenticeship in my dream city of Portland, OR, so I decided to get back into my studies (left off at academic probation) at the U of M- and ultimately graduated with honors in Architecture and Product Design.
                </p>
                <p>To save money while finishing up my last two years in school, I gutted and converted a 1960's travel trailer into an almost-complete living space.  I stealthily parked it in Northeast, Minneapolis where I successfully survived two Minnesota winters without running water. 
                </p>
                <p>More recently, I have been a teaching assistant in the Product Design department at the U of M and have worked for two years in the architecture industry designing, engineering, and fabricating complex curving steel structures using a mixture of modeling in Rhinoceros 3d and Grasshopper scripting. </p> 
                <p>My current goal is to be the very best- like no one ever was.  To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause.  I will travel across the land searching far and wide.  Teach Pokemon to understand the power that's inside.</p> 
                <p>Pokemon!  Gotta catch 'em all!</p>
